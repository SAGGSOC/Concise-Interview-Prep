# Concise-Interview-Prep
Preperation repository with concise resources for modern day requirements of Software Engineering Interviews. Specific Details to Techincal Rounds. 

---

__Most Important__ : Prepared Keeping 2-months preperation time in mind. You, definitely need background from each sub-section in order to achieve this.

---
__Rough Timeline__ : 
* __1st Month__ : Maximum coding practice and algorithmic analysis of them. Along, with minor work other sub-sections mentioned below. Must be able to complete all basics of coding in first month.
* __2nd Month__ : Company oriented preperation of topics and coding question practice. Preferred is pick top 6 companies for which you will be eligible for application. 
* __1-Week before interview__ : Revise flash-cards. Tailor resume accordingly. Brush-up basics of your project and never leave practising coding till the end.

#### Sub-Sections

These sub-sections are decided on the basis of latest requirements in current Software Developer interviews with few new topics added which are equally important when it comes to technical interview along with standard conventional topics.  

* __Languages to work With__ : Java, C/C++ and Python. Memory management and advantages of using each language with common Collections, libraries used in that language.
* __Data Structures__ : Inner workings of data-structures with common complexities involved in it. Application specific usage of these data structures.
* __Algorithms__ : Different paradigms and standard text-book algorithms will come in handy. Runtimes, limitations, classes & other detailed information is required. No pseudocodes, with each algorithm learned coding & different implementations related to it must also be understood.
* __System Design__ : Basic OO-design, scalable implementations, design choices. Distributed designs, service-oriented architectures, map-reduce, distributed caching, load balancing.
* __OS__ : All the basics of operating systems with memory management, processes, threads, synchronization, paging, and multithreading as a must.
* __Networking__ : Basic network models, All the important protocols, basic practical numericals. Can be asked implement your own protocol.
* __AI/ML__ : Basic search methods in AI, knowledge representation etc. All the basic models in ML with proper trade-offs. Learning functions/rates, activation functions etc. basic things.

#### Note
* New detailed preperation topics will be added for each sub-section.
* Flash-cards for each sub-section will be added.
* Url of resources will soon be added with descriptive analysis of topics.
